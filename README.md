# List-Builder
A script written in Python3 for converting a file of words into a custom dictionary for use in list-base fuzzers and password crackers.

To start: get a file of words from anywhere.  Copy from the internet, use your research paper, hand jam words into a fresh text file, anywhere!
First step: Start the script with the command - python3 listbuild.py
Important note! - even if your file is already looks like a list, run it through option 1 first.  This only needs to be done once.
Follow on steps: Select how you would like to manipulate the letters.  You can turn o's to 0's and 1's to !'s, and more!  Feel free to go crazy with your list and try everything once, twice, or twenty-times.  Watch your list grow and grow and grow!
Final step: Use your new list of highly manipulated words for whatever you want.

Note to other developers - this is not a highly sophisticated script and it is purposefully created to do things step by step.  Previous versions ran multiple iterations of each various option.  I found those versions over-worked and created uncessarily large lists.  However, open to suggestions and modifications to the code.  If you change the code, please share back with the community.

Thanks, and enjoy!
